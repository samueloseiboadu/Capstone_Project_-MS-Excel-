# INTRODUCTION

This project uses pivot tables and interactive dashboards to analyze sales performance and product trends. The focus is on identifying key insights into sales patterns, comparing fruit and vegetable sales across countries, and providing data-driven recommendations for improving business strategies.

## Key Features of My Project

Pivot Tables: Utilization of one-dimensional and two-dimensional pivot tables for detailed data analysis and reporting.
Dynamic Dashboards: Two interactive dashboards designed to provide comprehensive insights.

## Purpose 
   To provide key insights into sales performance and product trends.

## Objective
1. Dashboard 1: Focuses on sales and order trends across months to identify peak performance periods.
2. Dashboard 2: Compares sales of fruits and vegetables across various countries.

## Insights: DASHBOARD 1 (Overall Sales Overview)
1. March stands out with the highest sales, generating $104,566. This suggests a peak in customer demand or successful promotions during this period.
2. April saw the lowest sales at $49,474. This dip might indicate the need for targeted promotions or seasonal adjustments during this month.
3. While sales figures vary significantly, the order count remains relatively consistent, showing stable customer activity. 

## Insights: DASHBOARD 2 (Fruits and Vegetables Market Analysis)
1. The United States leads sales with a total of $267,133, making it a key market for both fruits and vegetables. The high demand in this region offers significant business opportunities.
2. Fruits consistently outperform vegetables across all regions, with total sales of $693,069 for fruits compared to $336,665 for vegetables. This suggests higher consumer demand for fruits or more favorable pricing strategies.
3. Countries like Germany and France represent strong markets that have the potential for growth, especially in the category of fruits.

## Recommendations
1. Given the peak in March, businesses should focus marketing campaigns around this month to maximize sales.
2. Launching promotions or discounts to encourage sales can address April's dip.
3. With fruits outperforming vegetables, companies should focus on expanding their fruit offerings and explore ways to improve vegetable sales.


## Conclusion
The project identifies peak sales in March, weaker performance in April, and stronger demand for fruits over vegetables. By targeting key months and expanding fruit offerings, businesses can optimize strategies and grow in strong markets like the U.S., Germany, and France.
